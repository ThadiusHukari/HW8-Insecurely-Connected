The toilet is one of the few things you would think is safe from the advances in technology, but the electric toilet is becoming more common, especially in Japan.

Many of the toilets can be controlled by apps that connect to the toilet via Bluetooth. Apparently anyone with the app installed can take over the functions like opening and closing the lid or spraying high pressure water.
